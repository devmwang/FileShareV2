# FileShareV2

A major overhaul to the V1 (now deprecated) FileShare application. V2 brings major improvements in both UI and performance. V2 is now based on a Python backend and a Qt QML frontend (using the official PySide6 Python bindings).

Same as V1, FileShareV2 is a P2P file send/receive application using the websocket protocol over open and forwarded network ports.
